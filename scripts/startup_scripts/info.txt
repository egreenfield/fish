The new init system for Debian 8 "Jessie" is systemd. The old way in Debian 7 "Wheezy" was Sysv with runlevels and /etc/inittab. A drawback of using crontab to run your program will be, if the script execution crashes, it dies forever. Restarting a script automatically if its ends is called "respawn".

As you can see, the Bluetooth Service is running and prints that a "Target" is reached. To create your own service, which runs after bluetooth startup, and respawns with systemd just create a file in /etc/systemd/system/ i.e. my_program.service

[Unit]
Desription=my_program with systemd, respawn, after bluetooth
After=bluetooth.target

[Service]
ExecStart=node /home/pi/workspace/my_program
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
and activate it

systemctl enable my_program.service
reboot or start it manually

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start my_program.service
If one kills the process or reboots, my_program will be restarted automatically some seconds later.
